Currently in development, the purpose of DoctorDoctor is to provide an improved user experience for reviewing Dr. Checks comments. After saving Dr. Checks comments from ProjNet as a XML file, this app cleans the XML, then loads it into a Treeview list, which uses text and background colors to identify the history and status of all comments.

This application doesn't currently have write functionality (by design) -- it's intended to be a viewer.
